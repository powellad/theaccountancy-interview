# 2. use-typescript

Date: 2023-09-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Maintainable and readable code is essential for any code base.

## Decision

TypeScript will be used to reduce bugs and increase the maintainability and readability of the code. It allows the use of better static analysis and linting tools compared to normal JavaScript. Further, Intellisense is far better with TypeScript compared to JavaScript, reducing the burden on developers.

## Consequences

Some people are resistant to TypeScript, so developer buy-in can be an issue. It can increase development time, but I believe the savings you gain in other aspects outweigh this downside.
